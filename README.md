## Titanic Dataset Analysis

### Description

The Titanic was a luxury ship, which at its time, was the largest ship afloat.It was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line.On April 15, 1912, the Titanic embarked on its maiden voyage and sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. The tragedy is considered one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history and led to better safety guidelines for ships.


In this project,we have been provided with 2 datasets to build a model prediction from which to check the possibility of survival.One for training (train.csv) containing survival and death information that we will use to train our model. One for testing (test.csv), without survival and death information, that we will use to test our models.

The steps taken during this study are:

- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Data Cleaning
- Perform EDA
- Modelling with KNN
- Evaluation
- Challenging the solution
